1. Homo sapiens ( Human) are highly complex organisms with a genome containing approximately 3.2 billion base pairs. The human genome is widely researched in genomics, with several versions being thoroughly annotated.
2. Number of features -3456533
3. Unique sequence regions - 194
4. Number of genes - 21571
5. Top 10 annotated feature types - 
1. exon
2. CDS
3. three_prime_UTR
4. biological_region
5. five_prime_UTR
6. mRNA
7. lnc_RNA
8. transcript
9. ncRNA_gene
10.  gene


      The File includes essential feature types like exon, gene, etc so it looks fairly comprehensive. One thing I noted was that I was getting 194 for chromosomes which doesn't seem right so I used more filters to remove unique sequence regions that are non chromosomal entities like scaffold names or contig and any non-chromosomal patterns but that did not change the output. Hence, I am not sure about the code/ specific annotation to use in this case.
